# KTH Local Volatility Estimation for Option Pricing
This project was completed as part of the SF2975 Financial Derivatives course during my semester exchange at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

The goal of this project is to estimate the local volatility surface from call option data; the <b>actual submission is not included in this repository</b>, only the Jupyter Notebook.
